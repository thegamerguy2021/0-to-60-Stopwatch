# 0-to-60-Stopwatch
0 to 60 is a python app I made using chatgpt (yeah im lazy). It is meant to help time how fast your car can go from 0 to 60 (or any speed) in almost any video game. Currently, the app only supports some versions of macOS and Windows. Known issues: The app will take 10-30 seconds to open and load up because it does not have its own loading screen.
